[[data-views-in-sec]]
= {Data-sources} in Elastic Security

The active {data-source} determines which data appears throughout {es-sec}.
{Data-sources} are defined by the index patterns they include.
Only data from the {es} {ref}/documents-indices.html[indices], {ref}/data-streams.html[data streams], or {ref}/alias.html[index aliases] specified in the active {data-source} will appear.


=== How to switch {data-sources}

You can tell which {data-source} is active by clicking the {Data-source} button that appears at the upper right of {es-sec} pages that display data, such as Overview, Alerts, or Hosts.
To switch to another existing {data-source}, click the same button {Data-source} and choose a different {data-source} under `Choose {data-source}`:

=== How to create or modify {data-sources}:

To modify or delete an existing {data-source} or to define a new one, you need the required permissions.
To learn more, refer to {apm-app-ref}/data-views.html[{kib} {Data-Sources}].


=== The default {data-source}

The first time you add data to an {es-sec} instance within a given {apm-app-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[space], the default {data-source} gets generated for that space and becomes active.
If you delete the active {data-source} when there are no other defined {data-sources}, the default {data-source} will regenerate and become active upon the refresh of any {es-sec} page in that space, because the app requires a {data-source} to function.

The default {data-source} is defined by the `securitySolution:defaultIndex` setting, which you can modify from the Security Solution section of {kib}'s advanced settings (**Stack Management** > **Advanced Settings** > **Security Solution**):

The preset value for `securitySolution:defaultIndex` is (comma-delimited): `apm-*-transaction*,auditbeat-*,endgame-*,filebeat-*,logs-*,packetbeat-*,winlogbeat-*`.
This includes, for example, all data shipped via {beats} or the {agent}.
